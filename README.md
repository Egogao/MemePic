# MemePic

## First Updated 2025.2.11

### Upload the first version of the MEME processing function by using the prompt to do MEME image understanding by applying Janus-pro-7b multimodal understanding model. Besides, storing the output text in a specific format for better information collection in the latter steps.

## Second update 2025.2.24

### Upload an image understanding dataset from Maity, Jha, Saha, & Bhattacharyy's (2022) work, a multimodal dataset including image and text data. The Image Summary function will use a prompt "Explain this meme, Please use the following format the express the results: <IMAGE_ANALYSIS>; Visual Elements :: 'your description output'; Symbolic Significance :: 'your description output'; Overall Tone :: 'your description output'; <IMAGE_ANALYSIS>" to control and regular the Janus-pro-7b output. This is the first processed rough data, and it needs the following regularization.
